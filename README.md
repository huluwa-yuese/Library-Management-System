# Library-Management-System

This Project is basically about the how the Library system function. Mainly between the Library administrator and the Users(Students)
The Project is such that the administrator has absolute control over the central system and can have access to specific features such as listing Books, Deleting Books and updating Book records.
My project has two main parts that is , Part A which I term as the administrator Section and Part B( The student or User Section).
I started with the backend (java)of website by begining with the Adminstrative Password match of the website.
The administrator need to Enter a Username and Password anytime he or she try to login into the website and perform any administrative duty (Either to upload, Delete or list Books)

This Function or code gets activated anytime the admin enters the Username and Password it Checks with the Database to see if the Password the admin entered matched the recorded or stored details in the database.
see()

The Second Function or Code is JUST for the admin and it explains and shows the main duty of the admin .
The indicate the functions of the admistrator such as, adding a book to the record, deleting a book, Editing a book ,book match and count just for the admin to keep track of the daily activities of the library System.

The Third Code or Function is USER base or in simple terms for the user.It checks with the database when students or users want to lend Book

The forth package checks all user card record with the database to either accept or decline card input such as Card Password, Finding the userid match, Card name and other match count on the card .
This function is important as it check all incoming card updates or records wo ensure correct and traceable system information just in case of a missing book .
And then the forth package ,Gives the user or student an option to input personal data to be stored in the database such as ,Name. Date of Birth readerid and telephone number just for the purposes of record keeping.
