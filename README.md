DOCTOR Management System

Doctor Management System is basically like the Hospital management System
The website I created has to do with the daily activities if the Hospital and it's medical routine .I first started off with the skeleton of the webside htlm codes that is delt with the header , body and footer and all that the frontend of the website contains

The upper part of my website contains the Home button ,Specifications, Contact and the about page. For a Hospital and a website that seek to address the daily in flow and comfortable Doctor to Patient relationship, I included several specializations such as Cardiology, Bone(Orthopaedics), Neurology ,Dentistry, Radiology, Obsterics and other specialities. 

The third button from the left the contact details of my website, and then the about page which basically consist of the Goal of the Hospital, Objectives and Functions of the Hospital.

Html focusing on the basically the records(Personal records ) and data of both patients ,Doctor and the admin.

The login portal on the frontend of the website for admin, Doctor and patient literally the css to check up with the database when data input match up with the database or not.
